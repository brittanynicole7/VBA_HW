# VBA Homework

# Overview
For this activity, we were asked to loop through all the stocks for the year and print the Ticker Names, Yearly Change, Percent Change, and Total Stock Volume into a summary table. We were also asked to change the color of the cells so that negative percent changes appeared in red cells and positive green cells. We tasked with the challenge of creating another table to print out ticker names associated with greatest % increase, decrease, and greatest volume. Lastly, we were asked to loop through each of the worksheets to produce these outputs. 

# Results 
For the above activity, I consolidated information for each ticker throughout the year into values reflecting yearly change, percent change, and total stock volume. I also highlighted which stocks had negative and positive yearly changes and created a summary of the stocks that had the greatest % increase, decrease, and greatest total stock volume.
